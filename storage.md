## Basics
Storage, which is responsible for the long term of storage of data, is one of the less important components when it comes to building a computer. While you must have some form of storage for you system, the type doesn't matter. 

## Types
There are three common type of storage to consider to when building and are as follows:

### - SSD
SSD, also called Solid Slate Drives, is the fastest form of storage that you would want to consider when building you computer. While options for the amount of storage do vary, and become more expensive the more storage they offer, this type of storage is ideal for the applications that you use most often since it offers quick read and write times. 

### - M.2
M.2 Storage is a type of SSD storage that sits directly on your motherboard. Every motherboard will have a certain number of M.2 slots on it. M.2 offers faster read and write times compared to SSD drives that that connect through cables. 

### - HDD
HDD, also known as hard disk drive, is the slowest option mentioned in this tutorial. While you won't be able to read and write files to this form of storage as quickly as you could with an SSD, the price per gb is significantly lower when compared to its SSD counterparts. For $130 you can purchase 8tb of HDD storage or 2tb of ssd storage. HDD is the best option for applications that aren't used quite as frequently but you may still access too.
