# GPU - Graphics Processing Unit

## Basics
The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is another critical component of any computer responsible for rendering images and videos. GPUs contain a type of dedicated memory called Video Ram (VRAM) responsible for storing textures and graphics data. There two common types of GPUs are integrated and dedicated. 

### - Integrated
Integrated GPUs are either built into the CPU or motherboard. They share system memory with the CPU and are generally suited for limited to lightweight graphic tasks like web browsing, watching movies, and office tasks. Integrated GPUs are common in laptops. 

### - Dedicated
Dedicated GPUs are external graphic cards that are much more capable than their integrated couterparts. They often contain significantly more VRAM and can handle much more intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering. The more VRAM a GPU has the larger the form factor, but in return you are able to render graphics at a more efficient rate and play games at higher graphical settings and achience higher framerates. 

##Brands

### - Nvidia
[Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) is the leading GPU brand known for their high-end and high-performance graphics cards. Their GPU offerings are wide, catering to specific uses from gaming to professional graphic rendering. They contain a feature known as DLSS3 which is suitable for raytracing. 

Here is a link to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) that explains ray tracing in detail. 

### - AMD
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/pro-technologies?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmsurBhBvEiwA6e-WPCQipNuK6Ru_NcJrHLoVOjzRyEH-4s4fG-RsGnxcEKKmqsmXZx9YlhoCEzsQAvD_BwE) is another leading GPU brand, and much like their CPUs, their GPUs offer a very competitive price for their performance. They also feature a wide range of GPUs depending on you specific needs. Some of their recent models offer better performance than their Nvidia counterparts, but are still not as capable as Nvidia cards when it comes to raytracing.

### - Intel
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) has recently entered the GPU market to provide new competive options. While they are new, it is expected Intel will eventually offer a wide range of GPUs for different tasks much like their competitors. However, it might be best to wait a few more years before purchasing a dedicated GPU from Intel.
