## Basics
Memory or best known as RAM - Random Access Memory - is tempory storage for data that the CPU can access quickly.

## Types of RAM

There are many different types of RAM, however, the type of RAM commonly used in your typical computer are as follows:

- DDR4: DDR4 is the current standard that you will find in most prebuild desktops and laptops. While it isn't the fastest type of memory that you can integrate into you PC... It does offer the best performance for the price.

- DDR5: DDR5 is the next-generation of RAM. It brings faster transfer rate and efficieny when compared to DDR4. If you are wanting to future proof you PC then this will be the best choice for you. However, make sure that your motherboard will support it as not all motherboards currently offer support for this next-generation of Ram.

### Capacity
RAM is offered by the "stick" and features many different capacities. You can purchase four sticks of RAM that have a combined total of 32gb (8gb a piece) or two sticks with a combined total of 32gb (16gb a piece). The more RAM a "stick" has the more costly it will be (a 16gb stick will cost more than an 8gb stick), however, if you need (or desire) a signficiant amount of RAM, say 64gb, then you will have no choice but to purchase four 16gb sticks. 

### MHz
RAM speed, also descirbed as MHz, determines how fast data can wrote to it and how fast it can be read. The faster the RAM speed, the better you system will perform.
