## Types

- Non-Modular power supplies, as the name suggests, are the exact opposite of modular power supplies. The cables it comes with are fixed to the power supply and can result in a cluttered case and are not ideal when it comes to building systems will smaller form factors.

### Wattage
Every component needs a certain amount of power to run and function properly. There are many wattage calculators online, however, it is hard to determine the exact wattage a system will require. The best was to determine what you need will be to either research systems with the same key components as yours or read the description of each product to find the estimated power draw. If you are unable to find the information that you need, buy a bigger power supply. While it will cost more to purchase powersupplies that draw more power, it won't hurt your system to have the available power. Additionally, if you plan on over clocking the components of your computer, make sure to account for that as it will require more power.

### 80 PLUS Certification
