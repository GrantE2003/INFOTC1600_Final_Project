Building a PC can be quite complex and overwhelming to anyone who has never built a pc before or has very little knowledge about computers. The Purpose of this guide is to explain how each component works and how to choose the parts that best suite your needs. Before you begin selecting parts you should set out a budget and decide what you are going to use this computer for. If you have a budget of $500 and only plan on using the computer to watch youtube and browse the web then you should save your money and time by purchasing a laptop. If you have a larger budget say around $1000 and only plan on performing more lightweight tasks such as basic video editing, simple modeling, or playing games that don't require much processing or graphical power then perhaps a gaming laptop which generally offers more power than a basic laptop may be the right choice for you. That being said, if you plan on using the computer for intensive projects such as modeling and animation, video editing where render time and frame rate is important, playing games, and/or running programs that are processor and graphic demanding then building a pc will be the right choice.

If buy the end of this guide you are unsure what components you should use or if the parts you have selected aren't compatable the [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com) is a great resource to use.
