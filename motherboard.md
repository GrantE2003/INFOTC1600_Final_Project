## Basics
The motherboard is the skelton of the computer and is the central hub that connect everything together. 

### - Form Factor
The form factor of a motherboard determines its size and shape. As mentioned earlier some of the most common form factors are as follows:

1. Mini-ITX: The smallest form factor, ideal for small builds. Options can be limited and hinder performace.
2. Micro-ATX: Suitable for compact builds where you still value performance.
3. ATX: The standard size and unless you are building a NASA super computer... this size will be the most suitable for most desktop PCs. Many options for parts and best performace options for your average user. 


When selecting your motherboard, its form factor should also match the form factor of your case to ensure a correct fit.

### - Socket Type
The socket is the interface between you motherboard and CPU. To ensure compatiabilty between your CPU and your motherboard you must ensure they use the same socket types. 

Common socket types are as follows:
- LGA: LGA socket types are compatible with Intel chip sets, however, it must be noted that there are different LGA series depending on the chosen CPU.
- AM4 & AM5: These socket types are compatible with AMD Ryzen chip sets, but like LGA, depending on your particular CPU the socket that you use for your build may vary. 

### RAM Slots
Motherboards often feature either dual or quad channels for installing RAM. The number of RAM slots typically determine the max amount of RAM that your computer can supoort. 

### Expansion Slots
Expansion slots allow for the instalation of additional components like graphic cards, sound cards, video capture cards, and additonal storage.

Depending on your needs the number of expansion slots needed will vary. For example, if you are a content creator you would want to have two expansion slots, one for your GPU and one for your video capture card. 

### Other things to consider
The number of ports and connectors for things such as storage, audio, and internet are something that should also be considered. If you don't have access to an ethernet port but have wifi then you should make sure your motherboard features wifi compatibilities. If you would like to connect speakers then make sure you have the appropriate audio jacks needed. If you want to use a wireless mouse and keyboard make sure the motherboard features at least two usb ports.
