## Basics
Your cooler is essential for making sure the components of PC stay cool and within their optimal operating ranges. Components that overheat can result in performance throttling or system failure. 

When considering a cooler, consider what you plan on using your computer for. If you plan on running intensive and demanding tasks invest in a higher-end cooler to help prevent any system errors. 

## Types
There are three common types of coolers and are as follows:

### - Fan Coolers
Fan coolers use fans to dissipate heat from the CPU. They are mount directly on top of your CPU making them cost-effective and easy to install, and a popular choice for many users.

### - AIO Coolers
AIO coolers combine liquid cooling with the simplicity of air cooling. They offer efficient heat dissipation and are suitable for users who want a balance between performance and ease of installation. They generally feature some sort of hub that mounts on your CPU, features tubing that circulate water to the radiator to disapate heat, and fans that can pull hot air out of the case. 

### - Water Coolers
Water coolers use a closed-loop system to circulate coolant and dissipate heat. They are effective at keeping temperatures low and are favored by enthusiasts and gamers pushing their systems to the limits. However, they can be quite expensive and dificult to build, and can damage your system if not properly installed.

## Other Cooling Considerdations

### - Case Fans
Many cases but not all come with pre-installed fans that you just have to have plug into the motherboard. These fans can be set to pull cool air into the case to help with temperature regulation. Try to choose a case with built in fans if you don't want to pay for individual fans.

### - Case Choice
Choosing a case with good airflow is essential to adding an extra level of cooling capabilties. Many cases feature glass sides and while those are nice because you can see everything inside the case it severly limits the cooling capabilities of the computer. If you don't plan on keeping the computer somewhere you can see into it, or you don't care about being able to see the internals opt for a case with a mesh side for more airflow.
