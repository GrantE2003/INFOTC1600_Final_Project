# CPU - Central Processing Unit

-- [Home](index.md) -- [GPU - Graphics Proccessing Unit](gpu.md) --

## Basics
When choosing your processor, it's essential to consider the tasks you want to perform. The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is a crucial component that handles various calculations and operations in your computer.

### Cores and Threads
- Cores: The best way to describe cores is that they are number of individual processing units within the CPU. The more cores that a CPU has, the more tasks it can efficiently perform simultaneously.

- Threads: "A thread in computer science is short for a thread of execution. Threads are a way for a program to split itself into two or more simultaneously (or pseudo-simultaneously) running tasks. Threads and processes differ from one operating system to another but, in general, a thread is contained inside a process and different threads in the same process share the same resources while different processes in the same multitasking operating system do not. Threads are lightweight, in terms of the system resources they consume, as compared with processes."

## Brands
When it comes to CPU's there are two major brands known as Intel and AMD. Each company offers a wide variety of different CPUs that offer various numbers of cores and threads.

Many people have a preference on brands and depending on who you ask they may recomend one brand over another. Some may say that Intel is better than AMD, however, in recent years AMD has caught up to and is beginning to surpass Intel in some areas. So as of December 2023, there is no superior brand. It all depends on personal preference, very specific use cases, and budget considerations. 

### Intel
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html?cid=sem&source=sa360&campid=2023_ao_cbu_us_gmocoma_gmobao_awa_text-link_brand_exact_cd_Intel-Brand-SEM_3500088532_google_b2c_is_non-pbm_intel&ad_group=brand_freeform_b2b1-awa&intel_term=intel&sa360id=43700071555342085&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmsurBhBvEiwA6e-WPHsKFwsqb2lDD_TSQS_bxaz13uFJms4jYi6Jxl3oIZEr_FmMylgCNhoCgGcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) is well established and was founded just a year before AMD. They offer a wide range of high performace proccessors suitable for various applications whether if be gaming, video editing, or more professional office tasks.

### AMD
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/pro-technologies?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmsurBhBvEiwA6e-WPKyUNl77zRRVSqON3vnL0mD2aZ3Cpvs8Q0j7ouQ0jBsYaKhijIEhcRoCs64QAvD_BwE), or Advanced Micro Devices is another leading brand. AMD's CPUs provide excellent value for the money. They also offer a wide range of proccessors suitable for various tasks. They offer very competetive performance when compared to Intel's processors and generally at a lower price.
