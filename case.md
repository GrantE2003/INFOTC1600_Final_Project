## Basics
Choosing a case to house all of your components is perhaps the simplist part of building a pc. There is not much to consider other design, form factor, and air-flow.

### - Design
There are thousands of different PC cases available to purchase online. All offering differnt designs, colors, panels, and lighting options. Thankfully, when choosing a design there is no wrong choice. You simply need to choose the case that you like the most given it is compatible with the other compnents that you are choosing.

### - Form Factor
Form Factor refers to the size of the case and determines the components that you are able to fit within it. The most common form factors in order from smallest to largest are as follows:

1. Mini-ITX.
2. Micro-ATX.
3. Mid Tower.
4. Full Tower.

When purchasing your case and motherboard, which we'll discuss in the following section, you just need to make sure they are both of the same form factor so when you install your motherboard the holes where you screw it in to mount it align. 

### - Air-Flow
Perhaps the most important part of considering a case is its air-flow. Air-flow refers to the way that air can circulate threw your case and good air-flow can contribute to the longevity of your parts and PC. Different cases will have different locations where air can enter and exit the case, but the most common locations are on the front, back, top, and bottom. The more airflow that the components within the computer are able to receive the coolor those components will stay helping prevent them from overheating and either throttling your performace or shutting the computer down. Additionally, proper cable management contributes significantly to maintaining good airflow within the case.
